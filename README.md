This repository has some templates that can be use on Azure DevOps pipelines.

You can reference this repository on Azure DevOps pipelines using resources:

```yaml
trigger:
  - '*'
pr:
  - '*'

resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: templates
      type: github
      name: bcochofel/azuredevops-pipeline-templates
      endpoint: GitHubConnection

stages:
  - stage: Release
    jobs:
      - template: azure-pipelines/semver-annotated-tag.yml@templates
```

The `endpoint` is a Service Connection to GitHub. You need this to get
repositories outside Azure DevOps.

**NOTE: You should always use ref to get a specific tag instead of master.
Check [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema#resources)
